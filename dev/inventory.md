The current inventory in The Hectogon as for Dec 2 2017
is a 3x4 grid of 12 inventory slots.
This document details different ways to pick up items to the player's inventory.

## Proposal #1 : Runescape-like
By right-clicking the bag, a list containing the names of the items appear.
Advantages :
- Easy to implement
- Does not take too much UI space
- Picking up items is fast

Disadvantages : 
- Player may not immedietly understand that it needs to right-click the lootbag
- Player must be within range in order to pick up which seems counter intuitive on keyboard based movement

## Proposal #2 : Realm of the mad god-like
An other inventory appears when the player is near a lootbag
Advantages :
- Easy on players
- Clean

Disadvantages : 
- Requires players to drag items which can be slightly tedious
- Requires players to focus on a part of the screen which does not contain their character

## Proposal #3 : Item list
When the player is in range of the lootbag a list of items appear next to the inventory. Clicking the item adds it to the inventory.
Advantages :
- Easy on players
- Picking up item is fast

Disadvantages :
- Requires players to focus on a part of the screen which does not contain their character
